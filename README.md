# **Calorie Burnt Prediction**
A calorie burn prediction ML model estimates the calories burned by an individual during a particular activity based on several personal and activity-specific features. This type of model can be valuable in fitness and health applications to give users an idea of how many calories they burn during different types of exercise.

### **Features**  
The dataset includes property attributes such as:  

- User_ID	
- Gender 
- Age 
- Height 
- Weight 
- Duration 
- Heart_Rate 
- Body_Temp 

#### **Approach**
**Data analysis** : Pie Chart to check Male-Female distribution, plots to check weight,height and age distribution, Heatmap to check
correlation between various features. 
**Data Preprocessing** : Had no missing values, encoded categorical features into numeric values 
**Model Selection**: Tested Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  
**Evaluation** : Assessed using MAE, RÂ² Score for accuracy.
